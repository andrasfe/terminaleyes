"""REST API server that runs on the Raspberry Pi.

Accepts keyboard and mouse commands over HTTP and translates them into
USB HID reports via HidWriter/MouseHidWriter. This is the bridge between
the terminaleyes agent (running on another machine) and the target machine
the Pi is plugged into.

USB HID endpoints (keyboard via /dev/hidg0, mouse via /dev/hidg1):

    GET  /health          -> {"status": "ok", ...}
    POST /keystroke       <- {"key": "Enter"}
    POST /key-combo       <- {"modifiers": ["ctrl"], "key": "c"}
    POST /text            <- {"text": "ls -la"}
    POST /mouse/move      <- {"x": 10, "y": -5}
    POST /mouse/click     <- {"button": "left"}
    POST /mouse/scroll    <- {"amount": -3}

Bluetooth HID endpoints (keyboard + mouse, optional):

    POST /bt/keystroke  <- {"key": "Enter"}
    POST /bt/key-combo  <- {"modifiers": ["ctrl"], "key": "c"}
    POST /bt/text       <- {"text": "hello"}

        The on-wire BT HID report uses int8 deltas (±127 per axis),

        multiple reports. ``/bt/mouse/move`` accepts only a single
        report's-worth of HID and forces the dev-side to chunk
        across many HTTP roundtrips — at ~5 ms per roundtrip across
        USB ECM this dominates wall time for large moves.

        This endpoint takes the FULL logical delta and splits into
        ±127 reports on the Pi, sending them back-to-back with no
        inter-report sleep. One POST replaces many. macOS sees a
        single high-velocity burst (rather than a stream of small
        deltas) and applies its high-speed pointer-accel curve, so
        callers must calibrate a SEPARATE pct-per-HID ratio for
        this path — see VisualServoHomer's fast-mode handling.
