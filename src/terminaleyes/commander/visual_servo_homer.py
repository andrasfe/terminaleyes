"""Visual-servo cursor homer.

Replaces the open-loop ``closed_loop_homer`` whose cursor position was
dead-reckoned from a fixed HID-per-percent constant baked from a prior
target Mac. On a different machine the constant lies and the cursor
never goes where the homer thinks it goes.

This homer instead **sees the cursor**:

1. Slam to the top-left corner (known coarse start).
2. **Calibrate** by sending a known burst horizontally then vertically;
   diff before/after; the moving blob IS the cursor and its travel
   gives a real per-session ``pct_per_hid`` ratio.
3. **Visual servo**: each step locates the target via ShowUI and the
   cursor via frame-diff against the previous frame. We send a move
   proportional to the residual, then re-detect the cursor in the
   post-move frame and refine the HID ratio online.
4. **Geometric click gate**: click iff the visually-detected cursor
   sits within ``CLICK_TOL_PCT`` of the ShowUI target for two
   consecutive frames. No "ask gemma to confirm" rubber stamp.

Reuses scene-map + ShowUI grounding from ``ClosedLoopHomer`` for the
*what* (target), but replaces the *where* (cursor) entirely.
