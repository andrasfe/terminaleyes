"""Long-jump HID predictor for the visual servo homer.

Companion to :class:`PointerAccelModel`. Where the per-step pointer-
accel model handles small residual moves inside the closed-loop
servo, this one predicts the TOTAL HID for a whole click trajectory:
given the current cursor position and the target pixel, return the
HID magnitude needed to land cursor on (or very near) target in one
shot.

Trained on aggregated successful trajectories — see
``scripts/build_longjump_dataset.py`` and ``scripts/train_longjump.py``.

The runtime fires the predicted HID as a chain of back-to-back
bursts (each clamped to ±127 per axis, the BT HID per-report
limit) without per-step captures. After the chain lands, the
homer takes a single capture, computes the residual, and lets the
closed-loop ``pointer_accel`` model refine in 1-2 more iterations.

Net effect: a ~50% slam-to-target move that used to take 7-10
closed-loop iterations now takes 1 chain + 1-2 refinement
iterations, ~2.5× faster.

        ``max_total_hid`` caps each axis so a model misfire on a
        sample outside training distribution can't slam the cursor
        through the screen. Default 1500 covers the dataset's max
        observed total (~1400) plus a small margin.

        ``calibration`` is an empirical per-axis scalar applied
        post-prediction. v1 was trained on slow-paced trajectories
        with ``SETTLE_SEC`` between HIDs, where Mac pointer-accel
        produces less motion per HID. The runtime fires bursts back-
        to-back which triggers a more aggressive accel curve, so the
        cursor consistently overshoots v1's predictions by ~15-25%.
        Scaling down by 0.85 on both axes brings the typical landing
        from ~9% residual to ~2% — well inside the closed-loop's
        recovery zone. v2+ retrains on chained-burst data and should
        be deployed with calibration=(1.0, 1.0).
