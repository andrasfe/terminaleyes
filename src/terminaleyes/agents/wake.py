"""WakeAgent — bring a sleeping screen / monitor to a usable state.

Sends a sequence of stimuli that wake monitors and dismiss screensaver
or clock overlays without triggering destructive shortcuts. Used by
LoginAgent and FocusAgent. Standalone-callable.

Skips entirely when the screen is already clearly awake. The Down-
arrow keystroke is a *targeted* GDM-overlay dismissal — when sent
to an awake desktop with a terminal/editor in focus, bash readline
(or vim) interprets it as a real key event, which corrupts whatever
text is being typed by subsequent steps. Self-check before acting
makes ``wake`` truly idempotent and safe to include in any plan.
