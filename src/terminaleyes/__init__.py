"""terminaleyes -- Vision-based agentic terminal controller.

This package implements a system that controls a terminal purely through
visual feedback (webcam capture) and keystroke output. The architecture
is intentionally indirect -- vision in, keystrokes out -- to support
future physical hardware control via Raspberry Pi USB HID.
